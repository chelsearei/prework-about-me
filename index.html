      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Chelsea or "Pipip" and I am currently learning how to code under UCSD Extension.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in the Philippines, specifically Malolos, Bulacan. I currently live in San Diego, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies mostly range from every art medium. I have tried and done a lot of mediums of art but I don't have a specific thing I like- mostly testing the waters out. I also love playing various video games whether it be on my PC or my Nintendo Switch. On the newer side, I've currently gotten into sewing and am working on sewing masks from scratch. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have a definite dream job, but I suppose it would be around the lines of actually enjoying what I do, no matter how hard it is. Hopefully one day I'll be able to find out what one thing I'm truly passionate about, so until then I'll be testing out the waters.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in sunny San Diego only the best city in the golden state!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I am curious about the ins and outs of how softwares work. I want to be able to start a career in the industry and expand on that, learning how things work in the technological aspect.</p>
